        <h4>Why collect these little things?</h4>
        <p>Well, when we travel and visit places, what can we take with us beyond pictures and memories? We visit these places to learn and look at their exhibition, views, objects and more but aside from the memories and pictures we gather from them, we canâ€™t take anything physical with us. Especially now in the era of digital tickets and QR codes. Tickets, pamphlets handed out, stickers, stamps, even packaging, these aspects are often overlooked to begin, yet they are physical reminders of stories from our travels! Through highlighting these little parts about our travels, we can grow to appreciate them and build stronger memories with the places we've been! We also learn to value the journey we take towards our sightseeing destination! Subway to the museum? Just landed and making your way towards the city center? These places aren't just limbo before our adventure begins, collect that stamp in your notebook! Read that pamphlet! Collect these things to remember your journey. Somebody put in the time to design that stamp, a small and </p>
        <p>Still not convinced? Some of these come at the low low price of FREE! Or at no extra cost after purchasing your entry ticket. Hooray for collecting and keeping memories a budget.</p>
