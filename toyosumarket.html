            <h2>Tokyo, Japan</h2>
            <p><b>Trinket Type:</b> Book, stamp, handout</p>
            <p><b>Location of collection:</b> 35°38'39.0"N 139°47'01.0"E</p>
            <p><b>Year collected:</b> 2024, December</p>
            <p>
                <b>Extra information:</b> If you're a die-hard fan of watching seafood being sold wholesale, be sure to arrive prior to 5:30 AM to watch the action unfold at the observation deck! Otherwise, it's an interesting location to visit get a glimpse and learn about the fish industry in Tokyo and Japan as a whole. Their information center has put in tons of work to provide numerous pamphlets, books, stamps, mascots, statues and plaques with information regarding the subject as a whole. Take advantage of it (it’s completely free)! Especially when so many tourists go to Japan to enjoy sushi and seafood. There are also numerous restaurants inside and outside of the market. The location requires a slight commute, but if you're in the already (after TeamLabs perhaps) consider a quick visit.
