            <h2>Osaka, Japan</h2>
            <p><b>Trinket Type:</b> Ticket</p>
            <p><b>Location of collection:</b> Approximately, 34°41'12.7"N 135°31'33.5"E</p>
            <p><b>Year collected:</b> 2024, December</p>
            <p>
                <b>Extra information:</b> Inside they were handing out pamphlets with information and a blank space for a stamp! I can't seem to find it now. Don't race to the top and be sure to take your time exploring the castle's museum, my favourite floor was the one of numerous displays with “holographic” projections of actors acting out historical moments regarding the area and castle.
