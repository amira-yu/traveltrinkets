            <h2>Kyoto, Japan</h2>
            <p><b>Trinket Type:</b> Original paintings</p>
            <p><b>Location of collection:</b> Approximately, 35째01'29.0"N 135째47'46.7"E</p>
            <p><b>Year collected:</b> 2024, December</p>
            <p>
                <b>Extra information:</b> Sitting next to the river along this serene path in Kyoto was a young artist painting and selling their work for just 짜100- 짜200 (approximately $1-2). They did not have an overly distinct and over the top display with large-scale paintings, instead two to three boxes with postcard sized pieces. Beside they sat painting their next piece. Unfortunately, I did not gather the artists information, thus I am unable to link to their social media, website or other outlets, only their signature can be seen on the bottom of the art pieces. Please contact ASAP if you know the artist or are the artist and would like your work removed. To the artist, thank you providing me with the opportunity to purchase your work and enhance my experience and memory making of an unexpected Kyoto destination. This

            <h4>
                These paintings were made by an artist in Kyoto which I then purchased, please do not copy, duplicate or re-use these pieces for ANY reasons. The inclusion of these pieces is simply to bring light to a perhaps less visited walking path in Kyoto.
