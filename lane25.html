            <p><b>Trinket Type:</b> Stickers</p>
            <p><b>Location of collection:</b>  Approximately, 25°03'18.7"N 121°31'08.4"E</p>

                Extra information: I'm unsure if this area has a proper name but I'm just labelling based on the main street name! There is an array of small and cute shops selling trinkets, knickknacks, clothing (including vintage), shoes etc. I did not take down the name of the shop that I grabbed these free stickers from, but they had clothing and amazingly designed zines and booklets as well. Overall, the little street is nice to look at, take pictures of and walk around.
